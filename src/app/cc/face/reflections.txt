I thought it would be fun to allow the user to kind of configure their face how they want it, but in the form of a game.

The game I came up with was that the objects are falling and "bind" to the face when they intersect with it.
I drew a little sketch for this (which you can view under sketch.jpeg).

From there, I started implementing. I wanted it to be easy to add new objects in case I want to advance this in the future.
You can see that FallingObject is a type that fits eye, banana, and twizzler.

Bananas are meant to replace the mouth I suppose and twizzlers replace the hair, eyes are eyes. Just because!

Click to reset the face, hit S to save your creation.

Hope you enjoy. Definitely planning on making this a little more robust in the future.
